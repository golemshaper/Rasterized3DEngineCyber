# Rasterized3DEngineCyber

A game written in SDL and C++ built with `conan` and `cmake`.

`cmake` is a built tool used to compile and link C/C++ Programs.

`conan` is a Package Mangager for C/C++ which can download any third party libraries from the internet automatically. It then
generates any required files for the build, such as the `Makefiles`, that `cmake` can then execute.


## Structure

- `📁 ./.venv/`
    - A Python Virtual Environment. This folder stores any Python dependecies. It will be generated after first time setup
- `📁 scripts/`
    - Scripts for the first time setup of this repo
- `📁 SDL2GameProjectBPA/`
    - The source code of the game
- `📄 CMakeLists.txt`
    - The file describing how to compile/link our program
- `📄 CMakeUserPresets.json`
    - An autogenerated file describing how to run the build
- `📄 cononfile.txt`
    - A file describing which versions of the third-party libraries we want to install
- `📄 requirements.txt`
    - A file describing any Python third-party libraries we need during the build, such as `conan`
- `📄 release.py`
    - A script to execute the build and release

## Releasing
 
A production build can be done with `Python` and `cmake`

### Prerequisites

- [cmake](https://cmake.org/download/)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

### First Time Setup

> **NOTE**: This step only needs to be done one time when you first clone the repo.

After installing `cmake` and `Pythonn`, you must run a script which sets up Python and the package manager `conan`:

Windows:

```bat
.\scripts\setup.bat
```

Unix:

```bash
./scripts/setup.sh
```


### Running a Release

To run a release, simply run the `release.py` script:

Windows:

```sh
.\release.py
```

Unix:

```sh
./release.py
```

After the script completes, run the game with

Windows:

```bat
.\build\Rasterized3DEngineCyber
```

Unix:

```sh
./build/Rasterized3DEngineCyber
```
